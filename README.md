# Holmusk_NeuroBlu_Project_Fall2025
Fall 2025 USI capstone project: Holmusk Measurement Anomaly Detection Algorithm.

Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor are both supported.

To run, load the .py into the NeuroBlu interface, change the selector value at the top of the script and run the file.

Once run it outputs a dataframe containing the information about the anomalies, and multiple graphs showcasing the probability of a value being anomalous based on value/age/sex/bmi.
