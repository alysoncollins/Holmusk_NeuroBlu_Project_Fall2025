# Holmusk_NeuroBlu_Project_Fall2025
Fall 2025 USI Capstone Project: Holmusk Measurement Anomaly Detection Algorithm.


### Full Dataset Anomaly Detecting
Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor are both supported.

To run, load either Isolation_Forest.py or Local_Outlier_Factor.py into the NeuroBlu interface, change the selector value at the top of the script and run the file.

Once run, it outputs a dataframe containing the information about the anomalies, and multiple graphs showcasing the probability of a value being anomalous based on value/age/sex/bmi.
